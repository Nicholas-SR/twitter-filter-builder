# Setup: Twitter Filter Builder
1.	To run the Twitter Filter application you first need to login to a Twitter account. 
2.	After signing into the Twitter account you can then run the TwitterBlock.java file.
3.	The program will make you authenticate the application so that it can perform actions onto the Twitter account. It will open a page in your browser that will ask for permission to grant access to the account.
4.	Give the application permission and then it will display numbers on the page that you will need to enter into the java program. A small window should have appeared prompting you to enter in the digits.
5.	After entering digits into the window prompt, you will receive another prompt (might take 10 seconds to load), this time from the Java console asking you to enter a keyword. This will be the word that the application searches for in the tweet dataset to find users to block. The keyword must be at least two characters long.
6.	After entering a keyword the application will display the list of users that it will be blocking alphabetically.
7.	The user will have a choice to continue with the blocking or to exit out of the program if they no longer wish to proceed.
8.	If the user continues the application will block the users using the JTwitter library.
9.	The application will print the list of users the client is currently blocking.
10.	The client can see that the blocks were successful by navigating to their blocked accounts on the Twitter webpage.
